# Enviroment-Setup
Contains Information and Scripts to setup Dal-AUV's work environment 

# Download ROS and its dependencies
First, make sure you're in an Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're on Windows, the easiest way to run an Ubuntu environment is through WSL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Open the terminal, clone this repository, and move into the dat_setup directory.  

```
git clone https://github.com/Dal-AUV/Environment-Setup
cd Environment-Setup
cd dat_setup
```

Now run setup.py and wait for the downloads to complete. 

That's it!
